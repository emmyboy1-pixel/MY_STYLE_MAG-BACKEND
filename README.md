# TEAM COLLABORATION GUIDE
## Workflow Rules
1. Always create a new branch for your task
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  #### Example

2. Commit often with clear messages. example
  git commit -m "Created basic database connection, setup the different folder structures and created basic routes example to follow and code along

3. Before pushing, pull latest changes:
  git pull origin main

4. Test your code before creating a Pull Request

5. Request review from at least one team member before merging

## CONFLICT PREVENTION

1. Communication is the key. What so ever you are working on, please let the other team members know

2. Work on separate files when possible

3. Sync daily with "git pull origin main"

4. Resolve conflicts early if they appear

## CODE STANDARDS
1. SEQUELIZE MODELS. 
- Use PascalCase for model names
- Define all associations or relationships in models.index.js

2. CONTROLLERS:
- Follow the async/await pattern
- Always handle errors

3. ENVIRONMENT
- Never commit .env to GitHub
- Use .env.example for reference
